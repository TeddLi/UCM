45080697	in the next semester do you have any thoughts on what i should take? __eou__ __eot__	student	0
45080697	there are a few different basic classes you could sign up for next semester: eecs 376 foundations of computer science, eecs 281 data structures and algorithms, and eecs 370 introduction to computer organization. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
45080697	what different selection of classes can i take? i hear that eecs 281 is a core class and is very hard. __eou__ __eot__	student	0
45080697	i would guide strongly to take eecs 281. this will allow you to take many upper level classes. __eou__	advisor	0
45080697	both 370 and 376 are a moderate workload, so it probably would be difficult to take all three of these courses at the same time. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
45080697	it has been suggested to only take one eecs per semester. do you think i can handle two at a time? __eou__ __eot__	student	0
45080697	you could do two but it would be tough. however, these two courses are not too demanding, so it would be doable. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0

613323093	i'm not sure which courses that i should take next semester? __eou__ __eot__	student	0
613323093	great!  i have a few ideas, but first i want some feedback from you: are there any courses you really want to take?  anything that you're excited about?   if not, would you like me to explain the requirements first to get the conversation started? __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
613323093	i am interested in hci currently, so i am toying with the idea of a user interface class to start. if you could tell me the requirement's i'd appreciate that. __eou__ __eot__	student	0
613323093	ok so to take most upper level hci and ui courses you'll need 281, so you'll want to take that as soon as possible. for the major you also need 376 and 370. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
