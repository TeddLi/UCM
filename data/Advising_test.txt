624269671	a moderate workload can be expected in both 281 and 370. __eou__	advisor	0
624269671	so signing up for both of them in the same semester should be manageable. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
624269671	okay, what would you recommend that i take in addition to those courses? i've typically taken 4 classes a semester during my time here, so just taking two would feel like too little less work __eou__	student	2

624269671	yes, that sounds good. __eou__	advisor	0
624269671	so it seems like 281 and 370 are the best choices for you. __eou__	advisor	0
624269671	i think you should stick with 281 and 370 because there arent any other classes you can take. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0

670781220	hello, are there any intelligent systems classes available for next semester? __eou__ __eot__	student	0
670781220	those kinds o courses are typically upper level classes __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
670781220	i still need to take that __eou__ __eot__	student	0
670781220	well, the first 2 requirements are eecs 280 and 203. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
670781220	ok. what is the workload like for these courses? __eou__	student	0
670781220	so should i take them both during the same semester? __eou__ __eot__	student	0
670781220	plenty of students do take both simultaneously, so it is manageable. if you took both at once, your schedule wouldn't be too homogenous because eecs 280 is more about programming while 203 focuses on theory. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
670781220	alright, then i'll think i'll take both of those classes. __eou__	student	2
670781220	is it possible to sign up for additional classes too, or would you advise just sticking with the two classes? __eou__ __eot__	student	0
670781220	you can try some flex techs, as they are required in the cse program. you can also take an intellectual breadth course, as you need 16 credits of those. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0

418952172	yeah it is a common combination to take combination of linear algebra and eecs 280 and a vast majority of students are able to balance the workload. another commonly taken class with eecs 280 is eecs 203, which is discrete math. eecs 203 is a 4 credit class and is required for the cs major. once you have taken both eecs 280 and 203, you will be able to enroll in eecs 281 which is the "gateway to cs" class. __eou__ __eot__	advisor	0
